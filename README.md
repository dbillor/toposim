## Running the webpage locally

If you have built the project website or documentation as static HTML files,
you can preview it locally with Python's built-in HTTP server:

1. Open a terminal and change into the directory that contains your `index.html`.
2. Run `python -m http.server 8000`.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser to view the page.

This approach works on any system that has Python installed and requires no
additional dependencies.
